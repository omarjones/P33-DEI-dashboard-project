## Development: Gitpod (cloud workspace)

To launch the development workspace in your browser, including Jupyter Lab UI, visit: [gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/zhengzhangharris/P33-DEI-dashboard-project). See [docs/gitpod.md](./docs/gitpod.md) for more info.

## Development: container (local workspace)

To run Jupyter Lab on a local machine (this is mostly untested - consider Gitpod instead!):

```shell
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -v "$PWD":"/home/jovyan/work:Z" jupyter/r-notebook:latest
```
