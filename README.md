## Development: Gitpod (cloud workspace)

To launch the development workspace in your browser, including Jupyter Lab UI, visit: [gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/zhengzhangharris/P33-DEI-dashboard-project). See [docs/gitpod.md](./docs/gitpod.md) for more info.

## Autoreload

When working with a Jupyter notebook that imports an external Python module, the notebook does not incorporate changes made to external modules. You can:

* Use [%autoreload magic](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config/extensions/autoreload.html) (see [caveats](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config/extensions/autoreload.html#caveats))
* Restart the notebook
* Use Python's [importlib.reload function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.reload)
